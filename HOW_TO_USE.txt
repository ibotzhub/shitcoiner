╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

⚠  NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Shitcoins are extremely high risk.
   Scores show momentum only. Only risk money you can afford
   to lose entirely.

RUNNING A SCAN
──────────────
  Click  ▶ RUN SCAN  in the toolbar.

  The app fetches the top 300–500 coins from CoinGecko,
  scores them for shitcoin momentum, and shows the results
  ranked highest to lowest.

  Takes about 10–20 seconds depending on your connection.

  Options in the toolbar:
    TOP    — how many results to show (default 25)
    FETCH  — how deep to look: Top 300 or Top 500 by market cap
    INCLUDE BLUE CHIPS — show BTC, ETH, top-20 coins (off by default)


READING THE RESULTS
───────────────────
  Columns in the results table:

  #         Your rank — 1 = strongest momentum right now
  COIN      Symbol + name. [NEW] tag = recently listed coin
  7D CHART  7-day price sparkline — green = up, red = down
  PRICE     Current price in USD
  24H %     Price change in last 24 hours
  V/MCAP    Volume ÷ Market Cap — THE key shitcoin signal
              High ratio = huge trading vs coin size = something's happening
              Shitcoins mid-pump often show 0.5, 1.0, or higher
  SIGNAL    Momentum signal (see below)
  SCORE     Overall momentum score 0–1. Higher = more action.
              ▲ = score rising since last scan
              ▼ = score falling since last scan
  CAP #     Market cap rank vs all coins


SIGNALS EXPLAINED
─────────────────
  ●  STRONG MOMENTUM  — score high and rising. Most active.
  ●  VOL SPIKE        — big volume relative to coin size. Watch it.
  ◐  ACCUMULATION?    — high volume but score not spiking yet.
  ○  LOW SIGNAL       — nothing notable happening right now.
  ●  FADING           — score dropping. Momentum dying.

  These are momentum indicators ONLY. Not buy or sell advice.
  A coin can have STRONG MOMENTUM and then dump 80% an hour later.

TIPS FOR SHITCOIN HUNTING
──────────────────────────
  1. High V/MCAP ratio (0.3+) is the earliest signal.
     It means trading volume is huge relative to the coin's
     total value — something is moving before the price shows it.

  2. [NEW] coins are the highest risk + highest reward.
     Recently listed = no track record, tiny liquidity.

  3. Run scans multiple times. The ▲▼ velocity arrows on
     scores show you which coins are accelerating vs cooling off.

  4. A coin on the CoinGecko trending list + high V/MCAP
     + score ≥ 0.7 is the combination to watch.

  5. Add coins to My Bag with a score alert (e.g. 0.40) so
     you get notified when momentum dies — useful for exits.

║               ⚡  SHITCOINER  —  HOW TO INSTALL              ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

REQUIREMENTS
────────────
  • Python 3.10 or newer
    Download from: https://python.org

  • Internet connection (to fetch coin data from CoinGecko)


STEP 1 — Install Python
───────────────────────
  Windows:
    Download the installer from https://python.org
    ⚠ CHECK "Add Python to PATH" during install — very important

  macOS:
    Download from https://python.org
    OR if you have Homebrew:  brew install python

  Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv


STEP 2 — Install dependencies
──────────────────────────────
  Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) in the
  SHITCOINER folder and run:

    pip install requests PyQt6 python-dotenv

  That's it. Three packages.


STEP 3 — (Optional) Build a standalone executable
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  If you want a double-clickable app that doesn't need
  Python installed, run the build script:

    macOS / Linux:
      chmod +x build_standalone.sh
      ./build_standalone.sh

    Windows (Git Bash):
      ./build_standalone.sh

  Output:
    macOS   →  dist/SHITCOINER.app
    Linux   →  dist/SHITCOINER
    Windows →  dist/SHITCOINER.exe

  After building, you can send JUST that one file to anyone.
  They don't need Python or anything else.


TROUBLESHOOTING
───────────────
  "pip not found":
    Try:  pip3 install requests PyQt6 python-dotenv
    Or:   python -m pip install requests PyQt6 python-dotenv

  "No module named PyQt6":
    Run the install command again. Make sure you're using
    the same Python you'll use to run the app.

  Linux — app won't launch after building:
    sudo apt install libgl1 libegl1 libxkbcommon0 libdbus-1-3

  macOS — "App can't be opened":
    Right-click the .app → Open → Open anyway
    (macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned apps)
